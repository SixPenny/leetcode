## Description

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

Example:
```
Input: 4
Output: false 
Explanation: If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game;
             No matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be 
             removed by your friend.
```

## Solution

分析：  
```
1~3 win
4   lose
5   win (自己拿走1块石头，剩下4块石头地方必输)
6   win (自己拿走2块石头，剩下4块对方必输)
7   win (同上，拿走3块剩4块)
8   lose  (无论自己拿几块，对方都可以接下来拿 4-n 块使石堆剩下4块)
9   win (拿走1块对方剩下8块，对方必输我必赢)
...

归纳规律，谁面对 4n 块石头，谁输
```
So.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
}
```
