## Description

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

Note:

- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.


## Solution

1. DFS
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        return (TreeNode) lca(root, p, q)[2];
    }

    private Object[] lca(TreeNode node, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (node == null) {
            return new Object[]{false, false, null};
        }

        Object[] left = lca(node.left, p, q);

        boolean pe = (boolean) left[0];
        boolean qe = (boolean) left[1];

        // exists in left branch
        if (pe && qe) {
            return left;
        }
        
        pe = node == p || pe;
        qe = node == q || qe;

        Object[] right = lca(node.right, p, q);

        // exists in right branch
        if ((boolean) right[0] && (boolean) right[1]) {
            return right;
        }
        
        pe = (boolean)right[0] || pe;
        qe = (boolean)right[1] || qe;

        // may exists in left or right branch
        return new Object[]{pe, qe, node};
    }
}
```
