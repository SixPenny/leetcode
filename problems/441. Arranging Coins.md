## Description

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```
Example 2:
```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

```java
class Solution {
     public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        return arrage(0, n, n);
    }


    private int arrage(int start, int end, int n) {
        if (start > end) {
            return start - 1;
        }
        int middle = start + (end - start) / 2;
        long square = (long) middle * (middle + 1) / 2;

        if (square == n) {
            return middle;
        }
        if (square > n) {
            return arrage(start, middle - 1, n);
        }

        return arrage(middle + 1, end, n);
    }
}
```
