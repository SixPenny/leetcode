Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

    FirstName, LastName, City, State
    
## Solution

1. use left join

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

select p.FirstName, p.LastName, a.City, a.State from person p
left join address a on p.personid = a.personid

```

2. use union
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

select p.FirstName, p.LastName, a.City, a.State from person p
join address a on p.personid = a.personid
union
select p.FirstName, p.LastName, null as City, null as State from person p
where not exists (select 1 from address a where p.personid = a.personid)
```
