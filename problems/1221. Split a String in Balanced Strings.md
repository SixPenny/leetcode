## Description

Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.

Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
Output: 3
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
```
Example 4:
```
Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", since each substring contains an equal number of 'L' and 'R'
```

## Solution 

```java
class Solution {
    public int balancedStringSplit(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int count = 0;
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (stack.empty()) {
                stack.push(c);
            } else if ((c == 'L' && stack.peek() == 'R')
                    || (c == 'R' && stack.peek() == 'L')) {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                stack.push(c);
            }

            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
