## Description

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
```text
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.
```text
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

## Solution

1. use limit
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

select * from (select * from (select e1.salary as SecondHighestSalary from Employee e1
                              join (select e2.salary from Employee e2
                                    order by e2.salary desc
                                   limit 1) big
                              where e1.salary < big.salary
order by e1.salary desc
limit 1) t
union
select null) s
limit 1
```

2. use max

```sql
Select MAX(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee
where Salary < (Select MAX(Salary) from Employee)
```
