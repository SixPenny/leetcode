## Description

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
Note:
- Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

## Solution

TC: O(N)  
SC: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        long total = (nums.length* (long)(nums.length + 1))/2;
        for (int n : nums) {
            total -=n;
        }
        
        return (int)total;
    }
}
```
