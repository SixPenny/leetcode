## Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:
```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Solution

Some direction is not possible. So we add border check in unique paths.


```java
class Solution {
    private int[][] obstacles;
    private int[][] paths;

    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        if (obstacleGrid == null || obstacleGrid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        obstacles = obstacleGrid;
        return uniquePaths(obstacleGrid.length, obstacleGrid[0].length);
    }

    private int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        paths = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                paths[i][j] = -1;
            }
        }
        return uniquePaths(0, 0, m - 1, n - 1);
    }

    private int uniquePaths(int x, int y, int m, int n) {
        if (obstacles[x][y] == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (x == m && y == n) {
            return obstacles[x][y] == 1 ? 0 : 1;
        }
        if (paths[x][y] != -1) {
            return paths[x][y];
        }

        int down = 0;
        if (x < m && obstacles[x + 1][y] != 1) {
            down = uniquePaths(x + 1, y, m, n);
        }
        int right = 0;
        if (y < n && obstacles[x][y + 1] != 1) {
            right = uniquePaths(x, y + 1, m, n);
        }

        paths[x][y] = down + right;
        return down + right;
    }
}
```
