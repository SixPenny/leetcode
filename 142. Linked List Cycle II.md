## Description

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it without using extra space?

## Solution

1. 使用Set记录已经访问过的元素，第一次重复的元素即为循环起始点

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {

        Set<ListNode> set = new HashSet<>();
        ListNode next = head;
        while (next != null) {
            if (set.contains(next)) {
                return next;
            }
            set.add(next);
            next = next.next;
        }
        
        return null;
    }
}

```

2. `Floyd Cycle Chasing` Algorithm

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return null;
        }
        ListNode tortoise = head.next, hare = head.next.next;

        while (tortoise != hare) {
            if (hare == null || hare.next == null) {
                return null;
            }
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            hare = hare.next.next;
        }

        ListNode fromHead = head;

        while (fromHead != tortoise) {
            fromHead = fromHead.next;
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
        }

        return tortoise;
    }
}
```

```
If the preliminary tail is length 𝑇 and the cycle is length 𝐶 (so in your picture, 𝑇=3, 𝐶=6), we can label the tail nodes (starting at the one farthest from the cycle) as −𝑇,−(𝑇−1),...,−1 and the cycle nodes 0,1,2,...,𝐶−1 (with the cycle node numbering oriented in the direction of travel).

We may use the division algorithm to write 𝑇=𝑘𝐶+𝑟 where 0≤𝑟<𝐶.

After 𝑇 clicks the tortoise is at node 0 and the hare is at node 𝑟 (since hare has gone 2𝑇 steps, of which the first 𝑇 were in the tail, leaving 𝑇 steps in the cycle, and 𝑇≡𝑟(mod𝐶)).

Assuming 𝑟≠0, after an additional 𝐶−𝑟 clicks, the tortoise is at node 𝐶−𝑟; and the hare is at node congruent (mod𝐶) to 𝑟+2(𝐶−𝑟)=2𝐶−𝑟≡𝐶−𝑟(mod𝐶). Hence both critters are at node 𝐶−𝑟. [In the 𝑟=0 case, you can check that the animals meet at the node 0.]

The distance from the start at this meeting time is thus 𝑇+𝐶−𝑟=(𝑘𝐶+𝑟)+𝐶−𝑟=(𝑘+1)𝐶, a multiple of the cycle length, as desired. We can further note, this occurrence is at the first multiple of the cycle length that is greater than or equal to the tail length.
